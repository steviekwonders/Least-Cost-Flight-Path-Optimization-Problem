# Least-Cost-Flight-Path-Optimization-Problem
This Python project reads in a data set of Texas cities and their associated flight costs (if a flight exists between the two cities), which is provided in an excel sheet. Our program utilizes Python to find the cheapest flight path (direct or includes layovers) when the user inputs the departure and destination. While the data for this sample is small, it is scalable and can take much larger datasets without making any tweaks, given it is the correct format. We have a powerpoint and user's manual to go along with our code.
