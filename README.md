# Least-Cost-Flight-Path-Optimization-Problem
This project reads in an Excel data set of Texas cities and their associated flight costs (if a flight exists between the two cities). Our program utilizes Python to find the cheapest flight path (direct or includes layovers) when the user inputs the departure and destination. It accomplishes this with a dynamic programming approach where we make optimal decisions at each iteration. While the data for this sample is small, it is scalable and can take much larger datasets without making any tweaks, given it is the correct format. We have a powerpoint and user's manual so the user is well-informed on how to use our product.
